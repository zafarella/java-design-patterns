/**
 * 
 * When two applications communicate with each other using a messaging system
 * they first need to establish a communication channel that will carry the
 * data. Message Channel decouples Message producers and consumers.
 * <p>
 * The sending application doesn't necessarily know what particular application
 * will end up retrieving it, but it can be assured that the application that
 * retrieves the information is interested in that information. This is because
 * the messaging system has different Message Channels for different types of
 * information the applications want to communicate. When an application sends
 * information, it doesn't randomly add the information to any channel available;
 * it adds it to a channel whose specific purpose is to communicate that sort of
 * information. Likewise, an application that wants to receive particular information
 * doesn't pull info off some random channel; it selects what channel to get information
 * from based on what type of information it wants.
 * <p>
 * In this example we use Apache Camel to establish two different Message Channels. The first
 * one reads from standard input and delivers messages to Direct endpoint. The second Message  
 * Channel is established from the Direct component to console output. No actual messages are sent, 
 * only the established routes are printed to standard output.
